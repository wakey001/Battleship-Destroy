# User requirements and expectations
## Requriements
* Clear instruction as to when the game starts and finishes
* Validation of user inputs
* Feedback to the user on their input to the game
## Expectations
* I expect to know that it is my game based on a username
* I expect to know when the game starts and finishes
* I expect to have the option of reading the rules or not
* I expect not to be able to make any typing errors
# How to play
The user is prompted for their name, this is then shown above there board. They are then asked which row they would like to guess, row and column and also the number of turns is displayed. The user is then told if they hit or missed the computers ships and told of thier turns remaining, and subsequently told if they try to use the same co-ordinates later on. If the user hits all the ships they win, and the game is over, it is also over if they run out of turns.
